              Indeed, all praise belongs to Allah. We seek refuge in Him from
              the evils of our hearts and the evils of our deeds. Blessings and
              peace be upon the Messenger (PBUH).

              Marriage is a special blessing of Allah Almighty and an important
              Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH). The Qur'an and Hadith mention
              marriage as a means of purity, half of religion and a means of
              financial prosperity. On the other hand, moral degradation is
              taking place in the society while chasing this sick race of
              so-called equality between men and women of Westernism. The main
              reason for the infiltration of the uncivilized culture of the West
              in education, work, and marriage is the lack of complete religious
              education and not according to the Islamic Shar'i rules. As a
              result, marriage has become difficult and the society is burdened
              with various degradations including adultery, adultery, rape,
              suicide.
              <br />
              <br />
              On the other hand, it has become very difficult for those who are
              struggling against the family and social so-called customs to
              cling to the Sunnah in this age of terrible fitnah, to find a
              pious life partner. To solve this problem, some of us sinners
              dreamed of a Bangladeshi matrimony platform.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our aim is to build a Shariah-compliant Islamic matrimony platform
              for marriage through this website to facilitate the search for
              religious matchmakers. Encouraging marriage by breaking all bad
              culture of the Jahili society, making everyone aware against
              dowry- an eternal curse for the bride's family and popularizing
              Sunnah marriage with cash dowry. <br />
              <br />
              To make it easier to find a religious matchmaker, we have
              far-reaching plans which we are constantly researching. We are
              trying to deliver this service efficiently to all Muslim brothers
              and sisters as soon as possible. May Allah keep our intentions
              pure, make all our good deeds easy and grant us blessings. Amen.
